## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Upload Files**: Try uploading different file types through the file uploader
### 2. **Chat Integration**: Upload files and ask questions about them in the chat
### 3. **File Preview**: Check that file icons display correctly for each type
### 4. **Text Extraction**: Verify that text is properly extracted from each file type

### 5. **Image Processing Tests** ðŸ†•
- **Vision Analysis**: Upload any image and ask "What do you see in this image?"
- **Text Detection**: Upload an image with text and ask "What text is in this image?"
- **Object Recognition**: Upload images with objects and ask "What objects do you see?"
- **Context Analysis**: Ask "What's happening in this image?" or "Describe this scene"
- **Error Handling**: Test with corrupted or unsupported image formats

## Image Processing Features

### AI Vision Analysis
- Uses GPT-4 Vision for comprehensive image analysis
- Can describe visual content, objects, scenes, and text
- Supports natural language queries about images
- Provides detailed context and analysis

### Processing Approach
1. **Image Upload**: Images are uploaded to Supabase storage
2. **AI Analysis**: GPT-4 Vision analyzes the image content
3. **Comprehensive Response**: Provides detailed description including:
   - Visual elements and objects
   - Text content (if present)
   - Context and setting
   - Notable details

## Error Handling

The application now includes proper error handling for:
- Unsupported file types
- Corrupted files
- Text extraction failures
- Image processing failures
- Network errors during file processing
- AI vision analysis timeouts

## Dependencies

All necessary dependencies are already installed:
- `xlsx` for Excel files
- `mammoth` for DOCX files
- `textract` for DOC files
- `pdf-parse` for PDF files
- `openai` for AI vision analysis ðŸ†•

## Example Image Queries

When you upload an image, you can ask questions like:
- "What text is written in this image?"
- "What objects do you see in this picture?"
- "Describe what's happening in this image"
- "What type of document is this?"
- "Can you read the numbers/letters in this image?"
- "What is the main subject of this photo?"
